        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> This privacy policy explains how Kid Safe Launcher handles your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your children.
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Kid Safe Launcher ("we", "our", or "us") is a parental control application designed to help parents create a safe digital environment for their children. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our application.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using Kid Safe Launcher, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.
        </p>
        
        <h2>2. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Kid Safe Launcher does NOT collect, store, or transmit any of the following:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Device identifiers</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or telemetry</li>
            <li>App usage statistics beyond what is necessary for app blocking functionality</li>
            <li>Any data transmitted to external servers or third parties</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Permissions and Why We Need Them</h2>
        <p>
            Kid Safe Launcher requires certain permissions to function properly. All permissions are used solely for the app's core functionality and are not used to collect or transmit data:
        </p>
        
        <h3>3.1 Usage Access Permission (PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> This permission allows the app to detect which application is currently running on the device.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How it's used:</strong> We use this permission to monitor the foreground app and block unauthorized applications when Kid Mode is active. This information is processed locally on your device and is never transmitted or stored externally.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3.2 Accessibility Service Permission</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> This permission enables the app to intercept app launches and block unauthorized applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How it's used:</strong> The accessibility service acts as a secondary method to detect and block unauthorized app launches. This service operates entirely on your device and does not access, collect, or transmit any personal information.
        </p>
        
        <h3>3.3 Foreground Service Permission</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> This permission allows the app to run a background monitoring service.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>How it's used:</strong> The foreground service continuously monitors app usage to ensure unauthorized apps are blocked. A persistent notification is displayed to inform you that the service is active. The service operates entirely on your device.
        </p>
        
        <h2>4. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Kid Safe Launcher stores the following information locally on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whitelist of allowed apps:</strong> The list of applications you have approved for use in Kid Mode is stored locally on your device using Android's SharedPreferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Parent mode password:</strong> If you set a password for Parent Mode, it is stored locally on your device in an encrypted format.</li>
            <li><strong>App settings:</strong> Your app preferences and settings are stored locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> All data is stored exclusively on your device. We do not have access to this data, and it is never transmitted to external servers or third parties. If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data will be deleted.
        </p>
        
        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We take data security seriously. Since all data is stored locally on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No data is transmitted over the internet</li>
            <li>No data is stored on external servers</li>
            <li>No third parties have access to your data</li>
            <li>Data is protected by Android's built-in security mechanisms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            However, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your device. We recommend using device lock screens and keeping your device's operating system updated.
        </p>
        
        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Kid Safe Launcher is designed to protect children's privacy by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Not collecting any personal information from children</li>
            <li>Not transmitting any data from the device</li>
            <li>Operating entirely offline and locally</li>
            <li>Providing parents with control over which apps their children can access</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable privacy laws. Since we do not collect any data from children or anyone else, there is no risk of children's data being misused.
        </p>
        
        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            Kid Safe Launcher does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or data collection services. The app operates entirely independently and does not communicate with external servers.
        </p>
        
        <h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any information with third parties</strong> because we do not collect any information that could be shared. All functionality operates locally on your device.
        </p>
        
        <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
            Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can view and modify the whitelist of allowed apps at any time</li>
            <li>You can change or remove the parent mode password</li>
            <li>You can uninstall the app at any time, which will delete all locally stored data</li>
            <li>You can clear app data through your device's settings</li>
        </ul>
